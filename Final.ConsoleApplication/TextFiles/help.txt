Selecting an entity from the list
will show it's components in the
Components window. In the component
window you can edit properties.

The current components an entity 
can have are Render Components 
and Transform Components

Render Components: You can change
the model by enter a file path to 
a model file. Dae files generated
by blender work great. I can't 
guarantee other file formats will
work correctly but they probably 
do. You can also change material
settings and see how that affects
the entity.

Transform Components: You can 
translate, rotate, and scale the
entity.
